# Joe Levinger's Portfolio

This app is my portfolio site.

This is the repository for the frontend, which was created using JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX calls to the backend, HTML5, and CSS3.

Frontend Features:

* Created from scratch, without a starter codebase
* Use of AJAX to communicate with the backend
* Separation of concerns
* Showing and hiding divs, simulating multiple pages, even though the app consists of only one page
* Extensive use of CSS
* jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling
* Creation of a CMS, enabling the site's owner to perform all CRUD actions on the items in the portfolio

Backend Features:

* Creation of RESTful routes for handling GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests
* Integration of CORS, enabling the frontend to communicate with the backend, since they exist on different servers
* Authentication from scratch
* Integration of serializers, in order to control the flow of data to the frontend
